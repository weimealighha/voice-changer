A license key is a unique code that activates your software and allows you to use it without any limitations. A license key is usually sent to you by email after you complete the payment process. However, some people may try to obtain a license key for free by using a keygen program. A keygen is a software that generates fake license keys for various applications. Using a keygen is illegal and risky, as it may contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information.
 
Therefore, we strongly advise you not to use a keygen for Bonrix Voice Call Manager or any other software. Instead, you should buy a genuine license key from the official sources and support the developers who create useful and innovative products. By doing so, you will also enjoy the benefits of regular updates, technical support, and customer service.
