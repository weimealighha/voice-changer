You can adjust the soft selection radius and strength by holding down Ctrl (Windows) or Option (Mac) and dragging the mouse left or right. You can also enable auto-smooth mode by clicking on the icon on the toolbar or pressing S on your keyboard. This will automatically smooth or unsmooth edges based on their angles.
