You can find all these BixPacks on the official BluffTitler website[^1^] or on the VFXDownload website[^2^]. Each BixPack comes with a video preview, a description, and a buy button. You can also download some free templates from these websites.
  
To use a BixPack template, you need to have BluffTitler installed on your computer. You can download BluffTitler from the official website[^3^] or from various software download sites. BluffTitler is compatible with Windows 7, 8 and 10. It requires DirectX 11 or higher and a graphics card with at least 1 GB of video memory.
  
Once you have BluffTitler installed, you can open any BixPack template by double-clicking on it. You will see a 3D preview of the template in the main window. You can play, pause, rewind and fast-forward the animation using the buttons at the bottom. You can also drag the mouse to rotate, zoom and pan the camera.
  
To customize the template, you can use the tabs on the right side of the window. There are four tabs: File, Edit, Layer and Options. The File tab lets you save, export and import your projects. The Edit tab lets you undo, redo and copy your actions. The Layer tab lets you add, delete and modify the layers of your project. The Options tab lets you adjust the settings of your project.
  
The most important tab for customization is the Layer tab. Here you can change the text, font, color, size, position, rotation, animation and effects of each layer. You can also add new layers such as text layers, picture layers, video layers, sketch layers, particle layers and more. You can use the sliders, buttons and checkboxes to tweak each layer's properties.
  
To export your project as a video file, you can use the File > Export as video... menu item. You can choose from various formats such as MP4, AVI, MOV and WEBM. You can also adjust the resolution, frame rate and quality of your video. You can also export your project as a picture or an animated GIF.
  
BluffTitler templates are a great way to create stunning 3D intro videos without any hassle. You can use them for personal or commercial purposes as long as you respect the license terms of each BixPack. You can also share your creations with other BluffTitler users on social media or on the BluffTitler community forum.
