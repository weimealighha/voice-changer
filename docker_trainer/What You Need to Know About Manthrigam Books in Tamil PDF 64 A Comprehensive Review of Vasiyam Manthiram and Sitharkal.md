Manthrigam is said to have originated from the siddhars, who were ancient Tamil saints and mystics who possessed supernatural powers and knowledge. The siddhars wrote many books on various subjects, including manthrigam, yoga, alchemy, medicine, astrology, and philosophy. Some of the famous siddhars are Agastya, Thirumoolar, Bogar, Patanjali, and Goraknath.
 
Manthrigam books are rare and hard to find, as they are often written in secret codes or symbols that only the initiated can understand.
