One of the highlights of the book is the chapter on Omega's most iconic watches, which showcases the models that have made a mark on the watch industry and popular culture. Some of these iconic watches include:
 
- The Omega Speedmaster Professional, also known as the Moonwatch, which was the first watch worn on the lunar surface by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969[^3^]. The Speedmaster Professional has been part of every NASA manned space mission since 1965 and has also been used for various scientific and sporting purposes[^1^]. The book traces the history and evolution of the Speedmaster Professional, from its origins as a racing chronograph to its current status as a Master Chronometer[^1^].
- The Omega Seamaster, which is one of the world's most famous dive watches. The Seamaster was introduced in 1948 as a water-resistant watch for civilian and military use[^1^]. Since then, it has undergone many improvements and variations, such as the Seamaster 300, the Seamaster Planet Ocean, and the Seamaster Diver 300M[^1^]. The book also covers the Seamaster's association with James Bond, who has worn various models of the Seamaster since 1995[^2^].
- The Omega Constellation, which is a symbol of elegance and precision. The Constellation was launched in 1952 as a chronometer-certified watch with a distinctive star on the dial[^1^]. The book explores the different styles and features of the Constellation over the years, such as the pie-pan dial, the C-shaped case, and the claw design[^1^]. The book also highlights some of the famous wearers of the Constellation, such as Elvis Presley, Cindy Crawford, and Nicole Kidman[^2^].
- The Omega De Ville, which is a refined and versatile watch for everyday wear. The De Ville was born in 1967 as a separate line from the Seamaster, offering a more elegant and contemporary design[^1^]. The book showcases some of the most notable De Ville models, such as the De Ville Prestige, the De Ville Co-Axial, and the De Ville Hour Vision[^1^]. The book also reveals some of the innovations and technologies that have been introduced in the De Ville line, such as the Co-Axial escapement, the Master Chronometer certification, and the anti-magnetic materials[^1^].
- The Omega Marine, which is the world's first dive watch. The Marine was created in 1932 as a solution for divers who needed a reliable and water-resistant watch[^1^]. The book details how the Marine achieved its remarkable water-resistance by using a double case system that could withstand depths of up to 135 meters[^1^]. The book also recounts some of the adventures and achievements that involved the Marine, such as its use by explorer Charles William Beebe in his bathysphere dives and its display at various international exhibitions[^1^].

These are just some of the iconic Omega watches that are featured in "Omega A Journey Through Time". The book also covers many other models and collections that have contributed to Omega's reputation and success.
